Commerce Waitlist

Waitlist is an add-on to Drupal Commerce that uses the Commerce Stock and Flag
modules to allow adding products to a "waitlist" when they're not available.

As a waitlisted product becomes available again, an email will be sent to users
who added the product into their waiting list. This notification will only be
sent once, but the flagging will remain; So users will be able to maintain their
waitlists on their profile.
