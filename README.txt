Commerce Waitlist is an add-on to Drupal Commerce that uses the Commerce Stock
and Flag modules to allow adding products to a "waitlist" when they're not
available.
Additionally, a tab listing the user's waitlist will be added on their profile.
As a waitlisted product becomes available again, an email will be sent to users
who added the product to their waiting list (Using Message notify). This
notification is only sent once, but the flagging remains; So users may maintain
their waitlists freely.
