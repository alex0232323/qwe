Commerce Waitlist is an add-on to Drupal Commerce that uses Commerce Stock and
Flag to allow adding products to a "waitlist" when they're not available.

As a product becomes available, an email will be sent to users who added the
product to their waiting list (Using Message notify).

Additionally, a tab listing the user's waitlist will be added on its profile.
